# Dumping daily notes  
#Microservices Project v1

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a microservices architecture. It aims to demonstrate the principles of building scalable, maintainable, and efficient distributed systems.

## Features

- **Service Isolation**: Each service operates independently, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand.
- **Resilience**: Fault tolerance is built into the system to handle service failures gracefully.
- **Technology Stack**:
  - **Backend**: Django
  - **API Gateway**: NGINX
  - **Containerization**: Docker
